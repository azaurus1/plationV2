    Execute Round:
        requires that the prediction has started and locked once

        set currentRoundId to the id from the oracle
        set currentPrice(*SHOULD BE RATE*) to rate from oracle

        set oracleLatestRoundId to currentRoundId

        1) lock the current round with the current round id and the current rate
        2) end the last round with current round id and the current rate
        3) calculate the rewards for the last round
